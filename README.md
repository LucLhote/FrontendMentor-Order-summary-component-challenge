## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I discovered the ``text-underline-offset`` property. When comparing the version I had and the one I was supposed to have, I realized that the underline in my edit link was too far from the text. I tried to find a way to make it closer to text and found this property.

### Useful resources

- [text-underline-offset property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset) - This helped me set the offset for my underlined text decoration of the "change" link.
